# My Day 1 Project: Building, Hosting, and Designing My Web Application Using Azure and GoDaddy

Hello, and welcome to my Day 1 cybersecurity project! Today, I'm going to share with you my journey as I build, host, and design my very own web application using Azure and GoDaddy. In this README.md, I'll provide a step-by-step account of the tasks I completed.

## Overview

Today's agenda is quite exciting. Here's a sneak peek into what I achieved:

1. **Created an Azure web app**: The very first step involved creating an Azure web application. I got to name my application instance and choose my backend code and service plan.

2. **Chose a domain with GoDaddy**: Next, I selected a unique domain name for my website using GoDaddy.

3. **Mapped my custom domain to Azure's App Service**: I configured my custom domain to point to my Azure web app, making my website accessible to the world.

4. **Deployed a container on the web app**: I deployed a Docker container containing the framework for my web application.

5. **Designed my custom web application**: The fun part! I customized my website with my name, email, LinkedIn profile link, an introduction, a picture, and two blog posts on cybersecurity topics.

6. **Answered review questions**: Finally, I answered some review questions related to the project to assess my understanding.

## Resources

Before I began, I found these resources quite handy:

- [Azure App Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
- [How to come up with a good domain name](https://domains.google/learn/how-to-come-up-with-a-good-domain-name/)
- [Mapping existing DNS to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain?tabs=cname#a)
- If I ever needed Microsoft Support, I referred to [How to open a support ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request)
- [Split-Half Search](https://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=420908&seqNum=3)
- [Top CyberSecurity Blog Websites](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/top-cyber-security-blogs-websites/)


## My Day 1 Milestone

By the end of Day 1, here's what I had achieved:

- I created my very own Azure web app.
- I selected a unique domain with GoDaddy.
- I mapped my custom domain to Azure's App Service.
- I deployed a container on my web app.
- I designed my custom web application, adding my name, email, LinkedIn profile link, introduction, a picture, and two cybersecurity blog posts.
- I answered review questions to assess my understanding of the project.

These tasks boosted my skills in web hosting, domain management, container deployment, and web design.
