# My Day 3 Azure Security Activity

Welcome to my Day 3 Azure Security Activity repository! In this project, I'll walk you through my journey of protecting a web application using Azure's security features. This activity is part of a cybersecurity program, and I'll be working on several tasks:

- **Creating a Front Door Instance**: We'll start by setting up an Azure Front Door instance, a crucial step in securing our web application's traffic.

- **Analyzing WAF Rule Sets**: Next, I'll delve into Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule sets to better understand the protection they offer and how they can safeguard our web app.

- **Configuring Custom WAF Rules**: I'll demonstrate how to configure custom WAF rules to protect against specific security threats. In this case, we'll restrict access to our web app to certain countries.

- **Analyzing and Fixing a Defender for Cloud Recommendation**: I'll explore Microsoft Defender for Cloud, a management system that provides recommendations for enhancing the security of cloud resources. I'll analyze a recommendation and follow the steps to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

- **Answering Review Questions**: I've documented my progress and will answer review questions related to the project.

- **Concluding and Submitting the Project**: I'll conclude the project, submit the necessary deliverables, and ensure that any paid features are appropriately handled to avoid unnecessary costs.

## Resources

To help me along the way, I've referred to various resources, including:

- [Azure Front Door Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/frontdoor/#overview)
- [Azure Front Door Locations by Region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/edge-locations-by-region)
- [Azure Web Application Firewall on Front Door](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/afds-overview)
- [Azure Security Center Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/)
- For Microsoft Support, I have access to [How to open a support ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

## Getting Started

Before I dive into Day 3, I've already completed several tasks from Day 2, including:

- Creating a key vault.
- Generating a self-signed certificate.
- Importing and binding my self-signed certificate to my web app (for paid domains).
- Creating and binding an App Service Managed Certificate (for paid domains).
- Analyzing and comparing self-signed certificates and trusted certificates.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Creating a Front Door Instance

I'll start by setting up an Azure Front Door instance. This is a critical step in enhancing the security of my web application. Here's a brief overview of what I'll be doing:

1. I'll log in to the Azure portal using my personal Azure account.
2. Access the app service resource I created on Day 1.
3. Configure Azure Front Door, specifying details like its name, endpoint name, origin group, and pricing tier.
4. I'll provide screenshots to document my progress.

### Part 2: Analyzing WAF Rule Sets

In this section, I'll explore Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule sets to understand how they protect my web application. I'll provide insights into the different managed rules and their significance.

### Part 3: Configuring Custom WAF Rules

To enhance security, I'll configure a custom WAF rule that restricts access to my web application based on geographical locations. This is a proactive measure against potential security threats.

### Part 4: Analyzing and Fixing a Defender for Cloud Recommendation

I'll tap into Microsoft Defender for Cloud to analyze and address a specific security recommendation. This is a crucial part of maintaining a secure web application.

### Part 5: Answering Review Questions

I've prepared a document with review questions that I'll answer. This document will be one of my deliverables at the end of the project.

### Part 6: Concluding and Submitting My Project

As I wrap up this project, I'll ensure that I've completed all required tasks, including submitting the review questions with screenshots. I'll also manage any paid features to avoid unnecessary costs.

Thank you for joining me on this journey through Day 3 of my Azure Security Activity. Feel free to explore my progress and learnings documented in this repository.
